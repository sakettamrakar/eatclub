# Epistemic System Beliefs v1

## Belief ID: B-001
**Belief:** The system's digital ledger is an approximation of reality, and user input is the only valid mechanism to correct it.
**Why this belief exists:** The system lacks direct sensory input to verify physical inventory states.
**Confidence:** High
**What would falsify this belief:** Integration of reliable, autonomous sensors that demonstrate higher accuracy than human reporting.

## Belief ID: B-002
**Belief:** Core business logic for inventory mutation must be deterministic and devoid of probabilistic inference.
**Why this belief exists:** Probabilistic models introduce non-deterministic errors that erode trust and auditability.
**Confidence:** High
**What would falsify this belief:** Demonstration of a probabilistic model with 100% auditability and zero hallucination rate over a statistically significant period.

## Belief ID: B-003
**Belief:** Human confirmation is required for any permanent state change (T2 Execution on Approval).
**Why this belief exists:** The cost of false positives in inventory adjustment exceeds the utility of fully autonomous operation.
**Confidence:** High
**What would falsify this belief:** User demand explicitly favoring autonomous convenience over granular control and accuracy.

## Belief ID: B-004
**Belief:** System availability without external connectivity is critical for household function.
**Why this belief exists:** Dependence on cloud services creates unacceptable failure modes for essential daily tasks.
**Confidence:** Medium
**What would falsify this belief:** Universal, uninterrupted internet connectivity becomes a reality for the target user base.

## Belief ID: B-005
**Belief:** Trust is generated by transparent, explainable logic rather than perceived intelligence.
**Why this belief exists:** Users are more likely to abandon a "smart" system they cannot understand than a "simple" system they can control.
**Confidence:** High
**What would falsify this belief:** Empirical data showing users prefer "black box" optimization with higher theoretical efficiency over transparent control.
