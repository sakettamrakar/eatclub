# DWBS Phase 3 — Moat Deepening

**Objective:** Compounding advantage via household memory. Make replication expensive, not just difficult.
*Timeline: 6–12 months*

## D11. Pattern Learning (Delayed ML)
*Outcome: App learns household behavior. ML introduced only after sufficient data.*

### Key Sub-deliverables
*   **D11.1 Data Thresholding:** ML features enable only after ≥ 6 months of household data.
*   **D11.2 Consumption Pattern Models:** Learn "Buying frequency" and "Typical waste".
*   **D11.3 Seasonality Detection:** Identify seasonal shifts in pantry staples.
*   **D11.4 Explainability Preservation:** Model outputs must remain explainable (e.g., "Suggested because you usually buy Milk on Tuesdays").

### Acceptance
*   Model suggestions outperform rule-based baseline.
*   Explainability is preserved (Anti-"Black Box" AI).

## D12. Health-Aware Layer (Constraint-Based)
*Outcome: Personal relevance beyond inventory. Rules, not medical advice.*

### Key Sub-deliverables
*   **D12.1 Dietary Preferences:** User-defined exclusions (Vegan, Gluten-free).
*   **D12.2 Restriction Enforcement:** System strictly filters/warns based on constraints.
*   **D12.3 Long-term Balance Logic:** "You haven't cooked vegetables this week".

### Acceptance
*   **No medical claims.**
*   System enforces user rules, never prescribes health outcomes.

## D13. Waste & Expiry Optimization Engine
*Outcome: Waste reduction becomes measurable and personalized.*

### Key Sub-deliverables
*   **D13.1 Benchmarked Waste:** Compare household waste against its *own* history, not global averages.
*   **D13.2 Cross-Recipe Salvage Logic:** Suggest recipes specifically to rescue at-risk items.
*   **D13.3 Waste Analytics:** Quantify waste reduction.

### Acceptance
*   Measurable waste reduction over baseline.
*   Analytics drive behavioral change.

## D14. Household Intelligence Dashboard
*Outcome: Value visibility → retention.*

### Key Sub-deliverables
*   **D14.1 Behavioral Insights:** "You waste milk on weekdays" (Actionable insight > Raw charts).
*   **D14.2 Spend vs. Waste Tracking:** Visualize financial impact of waste.
*   **D14.3 Savings Estimation:** Estimate money saved by using inventory.

### Acceptance
*   Users can articulate value in ₹ terms.
