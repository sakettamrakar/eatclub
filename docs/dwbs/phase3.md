# Phase 3 — Moat Deepening (6–12 months)

Objective: Compounding advantage via household memory.

### D11. Pattern Learning (Delayed ML – Correctly)

Critical Change

ML introduced only after ≥ 6 months household data

This aligns with your anti-“AI first” stance.

### D12. Health-Aware Layer (Constraint-Based, Not Advice)

Upgrade

System enforces rules, never prescribes health outcomes

### D13. Waste & Expiry Optimization Engine

Upgrade

Waste is benchmarked against household’s own past

Not global averages

### D14. Household Intelligence Dashboard

Upgrade

Focus on behavioral insight, not charts

“You waste milk on weekdays” > graphs
