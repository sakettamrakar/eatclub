# Phase 2 — Trust & Automation (3–4 months)

Objective: Automation only where trust already exists.

### D7. Passive Signals Layer (Renamed)

Not “email parsing” — this is intentional.

Outcome: Signals ≠ truth.

Upgrade

Email/PDF create suggestions, not inventory

Confidence ladder visible to user

### D8. Consumption Inference Engine

Outcome: System learns when food disappears.

Upgrade

Cooking intent ≠ consumption until confirmed

Missed-meal detection as uncertainty, not failure

### D9. Voice as Read-Only Interface

Strong correction from earlier.

Rule

Voice can inform

Voice cannot mutate state

This is explicitly anti-assistant-hallucination.

### D10. Multi-Actor Household Model

Outcome: Real families, not single-user apps.

Upgrade

Actor intent tracking (who did what)

Conflict surfaced, not auto-resolved
