# FOUNDER CONTROL PANEL (GOVERNANCE)

## 1. System Health Signals
- Core invariants (Offline, Append-Only) currently holding; verification required on next commit.
- Logic determinism remains high; no unauthorized ML calls detected in recent logs.
- "Truth First" philosophy is active; agents are proposing, not deciding.
- Reconciliation between physical state and digital ledger is pending manual audit.

## 2. Trust Posture Summary
- All agents locked to T2 (Execute on Approval) or lower.
- No autonomous execution (T3+) enabled for any module.
- Human review required for all state mutations.
- Trust index stable; no pressure to escalate permissions observed.

## 3. Drift Watch Indicators
- Feature creep attempts detected in recent prompts (e.g., optimization requests).
- Phase 2 (Automation) concepts appearing in Phase 1 discussions.
- Metric-seeking behavior observed; strictly discouraged.
- Complexity of contracts is increasing; risk of "Silent Mutation" exists.

## 4. Recent Failures (High-Level)
- [Placeholder: Insert specific FTM reference if applicable, e.g., FTM-00X]
- No critical failure taxonomy records generated in last session.
- Minor friction in specific prompt interpretations; resolved via clarification.
- System successfully rejected ambiguous user input (working as designed).

## 5. Epistemic Belief Status
- System assumes user input is Ground Truth; verification mechanism weak.
- Inventory state is currently a "Belief," not a "Fact" (requires physical audit).
- Ledger integrity is trusted; data entry is the primary error vector.
- Confidence in "What we have" is moderate; confidence in "What we need" is low.

## 6. Governance Debt
- IDS (Invariants & Disqualifiers) documentation needs alignment with latest code.
- FTM (Failure Taxonomy Map) usage is sporadic; needs enforcing.
- Pre-commit rituals are manual; risk of human fatigue/skipping.
- Decision records (ADRs) lagging behind minor architectural adjustments.

## 7. Phase-1 Completion Confidence
- Core structure (DWBS) is solid.
- "Solid v1" definition is met technically, but operational fluency is low.
- Risk of premature advancement to Phase 2 is high.
- Recommendation: Freeze features immediately; focus solely on stability and audit.
